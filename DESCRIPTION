Description: Nowcasting right-truncated epidemiological data is critical
  for timely public health decision-making, as reporting delays can create
  misleading impressions of declining trends in recent data. This package
  provides simple nowcasting methods for practical use based on using empirical
  delay distributions and uncertainty from past performance. It is also designed
  to be used as a baseline method for developers of new nowcasting methods. It
  supports standard data frame inputs with reference date, report date, and
  count columns, is compatible with 'epinowcast' objects, and also supports
  direct use of reporting triangles. Alongside an opinionated default workflow,
  it has a low-level pipe-friendly modular interface, allowing context-specific
  workflows. It can accommodate a wide spectrum of reporting schedules, including
  mixed patterns of reference and reporting (daily-weekly, weekly-daily). It also
  supports sharing delay distributions and uncertainty estimates between strata,
  as well as custom uncertainty models and delay estimation methods.
  For more details on the performance of the method(s) in this package applied
  to case studies of COVID-19 and norovirus, see our recent pre-print at
