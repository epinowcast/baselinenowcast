Description: Nowcasting right-truncated epidemiological data is critical
  to interpretation of public health data, as right-truncation can create a
  misleading impression of declining trends in recent data due to reporting
  delays. This is sometimes handled by simply truncating the recent data, which
  has the disadvantage of reducing the amount of real-time information
  available. There is a critical need for a simple nowcasting method, both to
  address the public health need and to provide a standardised benchmark for
  nowcasting model development. This package provides functions for nowcasting
  right-truncated epidemiological data using a simple method based on empirical
  delay distributions and uncertainty estimation based on past nowcast errors.
  It provides support for modular development of a nowcasting workflow,
  enabling flexible implementation to allow for, for example, borrowing of
  delay distributions and uncertainty estimation from other strata.
