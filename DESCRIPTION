Description: Provides functions for nowcasting right-truncated epidemiological
  data using an iterative multiplicative model based on empirical delay
  distributions. Nowcasting right-truncated epidemiological data is critical
  to interpretation of public health data, as right-truncation can create a
  misleading impression of declining trends in recent data due to reporting
  delays. The method implemented here represents a baseline nowcasting method,
  intended to address a critical public health need as well as provide a
  standardised benchmark for nowcasting model development. The package provides
  support for modular development of a nowcasting workflow, enabling flexible
  implementation to allow for, for example, borrowing of delay distributions
  and uncertainty estimation from other strata.
