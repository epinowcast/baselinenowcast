#' Generate retrospective point nowcasts
#'
#' This function ingests a list of retrospective reporting triangles and
#'   generates a list of retrospective reporting squares, or "complete"
#'   point estimates of reporting triangles. It uses the specified `n` number of
#'   observations to estimate the empirical delay for each retrospective
#'   reporting triangle.
#'
#' @param list_of_rts List of reporting triangle matrices, in order
#'    from most recent (most complete) to least recent. Bottom right of the
#'    matrices should contain NAs.
#' @param n Integer indicating the number of observations
#'    (number of rows) to use to estimate the delay distribution for each
#'    reporting triangle. Default is the minimum of the number of rows of
#'    all the matrices in the `list_of_rts`
#'
#' @returns List of the same number of elements as the input `list_of_rts`
#'    but with each reporting triangle filled in based on the delay estimated
#'    in that reporting triangle.
