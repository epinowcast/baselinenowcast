#' Handle negative values in the reporting triangle
#' Takes in a reporting triangle and returns a matrix in the same format
#'   as the input triangle, but with negative values of reporting handled via
#'   passing them to the subsequent days (from longer delay to shorter).
#'   This code was adapted from code written (under an MIT license)
#'   by the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology RESPINOW
#'   German Hospitalization Nowcasting Hub.
#'   Modified from https://github.com/KITmetricslab/RESPINOW-Hub/blob/main/code/baseline/functions.R #nolint
#' @param triangle Matrix of the reporting triangle, with rows representing
#'   the time points of reference and columns representing the delays.
#' @return Matrix of positive integers with negative values of
#'   reporting handled via passing them to the subsequent days delay.
