# Mathematical methods for baselinenowcast

## Overview

The `baselinenowcast` model is based on the reference model for the
COVID-19 hospital admissions nowcasting challenge in Germany in 2021 and
2022^(\[[1](#ref-Wolffram2023)\]). Using a slight variation of the chain
ladder method^(\[[2](#ref-Friedland2010)\]), the method uses preliminary
case counts and empirical delay distributions to estimate
yet-to-be-observed cases. Probabilistic nowcasts are generated using an
observation model with means from the point nowcast and uncertainty
estimated from past nowcast errors. Users can flexibly specify the data
they would like to use for delay estimation and uncertainty
quantification, as well as specify the parametric form of the
observation model used for uncertainty quantification. Time steps can
correspond to any time unit. See the [Default
Settings](#default-settings) section for a full description of the
default behaviour of the
[`baselinenowcast()`](https://baselinenowcast.epinowcast.org/reference/baselinenowcast.md)
method.

#### Notation

We denote \\X\_{t,d}, d = 0, \dots, D\\ as the number of cases occurring
at time \\t\\ which appear in the dataset with a delay of \\d\\. For
example, a delay \\d = 0\\ means that a case occurring on day \\t\\
arrived in the dataset on day \\t\\. We only consider cases reporting
within a maximum delay \\D\\. The number of cases reporting for time
\\t\\ with a delay of at most \\d\\ can be written as:

\\ X\_{t, \le d} = \sum\_{i=0}^d X\_{t,i} \tag{1} \\

A special case of this is the “final” number of reported cases at time
\\t\\, denoted by \\ X_t = X\_{t, \le D} = \sum\_{i=0}^D X\_{t,i} \\

For delays \\d \< D\\ we define the notation

\\X\_{t,\>d} = \sum\_{i = d+1} ^{D} X\_{t,i}\\

representing the number of cases still missing after \\d\\ delay. In the
following we use uppercase letters (\\X_t\\) for random variables, lower
case (\\x_t\\) for the corresponding observations, and hats
(\\\hat{x}\_t\\) for estimated/imputed values. We refer to \\X_t\\ to
describe a random variable, \\x_t\\ for the corresponding observation,
and \\\hat{x}\_t\\ for an estimated/imputed value. The matrix
\\\mathbf{x}\\ with entries \\x\_{t,d}, t = 1, \dots, t^\*, d = 1,
\dots, D\\ is referred to as the *reporting matrix*. For a description
of the nowcasting terms being used in this document (e.g. reporting
triangle) and their corresponding abbreviations in the package, please

nomenclature](https://baselinenowcast.epinowcast.org/articles/nomenclature.md)
vignette.

| \\...\\      | \\...\\           | \\...\\           | \\...\\            | \\...\\ | \\...\\              | \\...\\           |

In the case where \\t^\*\\ corresponds to the present date, all entries
with \\t+d\>t^\*\\ have yet to be observed and are thus still missing.
As the available entries at its bottom form a triangle, this incomplete
reporting matrix is referred to as the *reporting triangle*.

#### Pre-processing of the reporting triangle

All of the following steps require that the reporting triangle only has
non-negative entries. In practice this is not necessarily the case. For
instance, if the reporting triangle has been computed from increments in
subsequent data snapshots, occasional downward corrections due to data
entrance issues can cause negative entries. We therefore apply a
pre-processing step to re-distribute negative entries across
neighbouring cells with positive entries.

### Delay distribution estimation

#### Estimating the delay distribution from a reporting matrix

If a complete reporting matrix is available, estimating the
discrete-time delay distribution \\\pi_d, d = 0, \dots, D\\ is
straightforward. Using the last \\N\\ rows of the reporting matrix
\\\mathbf{x}\\, we compute

\\ \hat{\pi}\_d= \frac{\sum\_{t=t^\*-N+1}^{t=t^\*}
x\_{t,d}}{\sum\_{t=t^\*-N+1}^{t=t^\*} x\_{t}}, \tag{2} \\ which is
simply the relative frequency of a delay of \\d\\ days among all cases
in the reporting matrix.

#### Estimating the delay distribution from a reporting triangle

In the case where \\t^\*\\ is the present day, such that only a
reporting triangle with missing entries is available, the estimator
\\\hat{\pi}\_d\\ from [(2)](#eq:pid) can only be evaluated after
discarding all data from the last \\D-1\\ time points. In order to use
these partial observations, we use a different representation of the
delay distribution via terms of the form

\\ \theta_d = \frac{\pi_d}{\pi\_{\le d-1}} \tag{3} \\

for \\d = 1, \dots, D\\. Here, in analogy to [(1)](#eq:Xltd) we write

\\ \pi\_{\le d-1} = \sum\_{d'=0}^{d-1} \pi_d. \tag{4} \\

The \\\theta_d\\ can be estimated via

\\ \hat{\theta}\_d = \frac{\sum\_{t=t^\* - N + 1}^{t^\*-d} x\_{t,
d}}{\sum\_{t= t^\* - N + 1}^{t^\*-d} x\_{t, \leq d - 1}}, \\

and translated to estimates \\\hat{\pi}\_0,..., \hat{\pi}\_D\\ via the
recursion

\\ \hat{\pi}\_{\leq d} = (1+\hat{\theta}\_d)\hat{\pi}\_{\leq d-1} \\

subject to the constrain that \\\sum\_{d = 0}^D \pi_d = 1\\.

We note that this method is equivalent to the so-called chain ladder
method^(\[[2](#ref-Friedland2010)\]), adapted to our notation in terms
of reporting triangles (rather than *development triangles* as used in
accounting). The intuition behind the method relies on the basic
assumption is that the ratio between the delays in the complete
observations is equivalent to the ratio between the delays in the
partially observed components of the matrix (Figure [1](#fig:squares)).

![Visual description of the iterative “completing” of the reporting
triangle, which relies on the assumption that the ratio between delays
for fully observed reference times is consistent with the ratio between
those same delays in the partially observed
data.](../reference/figures/reporting_triangle.png)

Figure 1: Visual description of the iterative “completing” of the
reporting triangle, which relies on the assumption that the ratio
between delays for fully observed reference times is consistent with the
ratio between those same delays in the partially observed data.

The `delay_estimate()` function ingests either a reporting matrix or a
reporting triangle and uses the last `n` rows to compute an empirical
delay probability mass function (PMF), returning a simplex vector
indexed starting at delay 0.

### Point nowcast generation

We now address the computation of a point nowcast, i.e., expected final
case numbers \\\hat{x}\_t, t = t^\* - D + 1, t^\*\\. These are based on
the reporting triangle, more specifically the preliminary totals
\\x\_{t, \leq t^\* - t}\\, and the estimated delay distribution,
\\\hat{\pi}\_d, d = 0, \dots, D\\. In the following we will denote the
current time \\t^\*\\ as the nowcast time, and the time \\t = t^\* - D,
\dots, t^\*\\ as the reference time. The difference \\j = t^\* - t\\
will be called the *horizon*.

An intuitive approach, used in^(\[[1](#ref-Wolffram2023)\]) and the
standard chain ladder technique, is to simply inflate the current total
for a reference time \\t\\ by the inverse of the respective probability
of observation up to time \\t^\*\\,

\\ \hat{x}\_t =\frac{x\_{t, \leq t^\*-t}}{\pi\_{\leq t^\*-t}}. \\

This, however, is not well-behaved if no cases at \\t\\ have been
observed yet, i.e., \\x\_{t, \leq t^\* - t} = 0\\. Then \\\hat{x}\_t\\
is likewise zero, which yields problems in our uncertainty
quantification method (see next section). Motivated by a Bayesian
argument (see [Zero-handling](#zero-handling-approximation) below) we
therefore use the expression

\\ \hat{x}\_t = \frac{x\_{t, \leq t^\*-t} + 1 - \pi\_{\leq
t^\*-t}}{\hat{\pi}\_{\leq t^\*-t}} \tag{5} \\

instead. This yields essentially identical results for large \\x\_{t,
\leq t^\* - t}\\, but produces positive \\\hat{x}\_t\\ even for
preliminary zero values \\x\_{t, \leq t^\* - t} = 0\\.

For our uncertainty quantification scheme we require not only estimated
totals \\\hat{x}\_t\\, but all entries \\\hat{x}\_{t,d}\\ of a point
nowcast matrix. For \\t = t^\* - D + 1, \dots, t^\*, d \> t^\* - t\\
these are obtained as

\\ \hat{x}\_{t,d} = \hat{\pi}\_d \times \hat{x}\_t. \\

The
[`apply_delay()`](https://baselinenowcast.epinowcast.org/reference/apply_delay.md)
function ingests a reporting triangle and a delay PMF and returns a
point nowcast matrix by “filling in” the missing elements of the
reporting triangle. The generation of a point nowcast is described in
the schematic below (Figure [2](#fig:pt-nowcast)), demonstrating how the
missing elements of the reporting triangle are estimated and can then be
used to generate a point estimate of the final counts at each reference
time.

![Visual description of the generation of a point nowcast matrix from a
reporting triangle and delay PMF.
](../reference/figures/point_nowcast.png)

Figure 2: Visual description of the generation of a point nowcast matrix
from a reporting triangle and delay PMF.

### Uncertainty quantification

To estimate the uncertainty in the nowcasts, we use the nowcast errors
from \\M\\ past nowcasting time points. See the [Default
Settings](#default-settings) for more details on the default settings
used in the package to define the number of \\M\\ past nowcasting time
points used.

#### Generation of retrospective reporting triangles

We first obtain “vintage” reporting triangles of the raw reporting
triangle (i.e., before pre-processing) to replicate the data which would
have been available as of times \\s^\* = t^\*-1, ..., t^\*-M\\, i.e.,
the last \\M\\ time points on which nowcasts could have been generated.
This simply corresponds to the stepwise omission of all entries with
\\t + d \> s^\*\\, which for each \\s^\*\\ is a diagonal from the bottom
left to the top right. The same pre-processing step as in Section
[Preprocessing of the reporting triangle](#preprocessing) is applied to
each vintage reporting triangle.

This can be achieved in a stepwise manner using the functions
[`truncate_triangles()`](https://baselinenowcast.epinowcast.org/reference/truncate_triangles.md)
and
[`construct_triangles()`](https://baselinenowcast.epinowcast.org/reference/construct_triangles.md)
which return a list of `n` retrospective reporting triangles in order
from most recent to oldest.

#### Generation of retrospective point nowcast matrices

For each of the \\M\\ vintage reporting triangles, i.e., \\s^\* =
t^\*-1,, ..., t^\*-M\\, we apply the method described above to estimate
a delay distribution and generate a point nowcast matrix using the
function
[`fill_triangles()`](https://baselinenowcast.epinowcast.org/reference/fill_triangles.md).
To indicate the data version on which it is based, its entries are
denoted by:

\\ \hat{x}\_{t, d}(s^\*) \\

for \\t = s^\* - D + 1, \dots, s^\*\\ and \\d = s^\* - t + 1, \dots D\\.

Note that estimation is again based on the last \\N\\ rows of the
respective reporting triangle, which must consequently contain at least
\\M + N\\ rows in total.

#### Fit an observation model to past nowcast errors

A point nowcast based on the reporting triangle from time \\s^\*\\ can
also be written as

\\ \hat{x}\_{t}(s^\*) = x\_{t, \leq s^\* - t} + \hat{x}\_{t, \> s^\* -
t}(s^\*). \\

Only the second term has some associated uncertainty, while the first is
already known at time \\s^\*\\. To quantify this uncertainty for given
nowcast horizon \\0 \leq j \leq D\\, we assemble the \\\hat{x}\_{s^\* -
j, \> j}(s^\*)\\ and \\x\_{s^\* - j,\> j}\\ for \\s^\* = t^\* - M,
\dots, t^\* - 1\\. By default, the
[`baselinenowcast()`](https://baselinenowcast.epinowcast.org/reference/baselinenowcast.md)
method assumes that we have count data that can be fit with a negative
binomial observation model, though the choice of observation model can
be selected by the user.

Assuming a negative binomial observation model, if all observations were
complete, we would then estimate the overdispersion parameter \\\phi_j\\
of a negative binomial distribution

\\ X\_{s^\* - j, \> j} \sim \text{NegBin}\[\hat{x}\_{s^\* - j, \>
j}(s^\*), \phi_j\], \tag{6} \\

with independence assumed across the different \\s^\*\\. This, however,
is not directly feasible as again some of the \\x\_{s^\* - j, \> j}\\
are not yet observed at time \\t^\*\\. We could discard these instances,
but this would considerably reduce our number of available observations.
We therefore use partial observations as available at time \\t^\*\\ and
assume \\ \left(\sum\_{d = j + 1}^{\min(D, t^\* - s^\*)} X\_{s^\* - j,
d} \right) \sim \text{NegBin}\left\[\sum\_{d = j + 1}^{\min(D, t^\* -
s^\*)} \hat{x}\_{s^\* - j, d}, \phi_j \right\]. (\\eq:negbin2) \\

We quantify the uncertainty at the target quantity level, which is
assumed, by default, to be the final count at each reference time,
summed across reporting delays.

Here, the use of a constant dispersion parameter \\\phi_j\\ despite some
of the values in the fitting procedure being yet incomplete is justified
by the fact that the negative binomial distribution is closed to
binomial subsampling, with the overdispersion parameter preserved. If
equation [(6)](#eq:negbin) holds in combination with \\ \left(\sum\_{d =
j + 1}^{\min(D, t^\* - s^\*)} X\_{s^\* - j, d} \right) \\ \| \\
X\_{s^\* - j, \> j} \sim \text{Bin}\left\[X\_{s^\* - j, \> j},
\left(\sum\_{d = j + 1}^{\min(D, t^\* - s^\*)} \pi\_{d}\right) /
\pi\_{\> j} \right\], \\ we thus obtain [(**??**)](#eq:negbin2).
Estimated dispersion parameters \\\hat{\phi}\_0, \dots, \hat{\phi}\_D\\
are obtained by maximum likelihood estimation. The
[`estimate_uncertainty()`](https://baselinenowcast.epinowcast.org/reference/estimate_uncertainty.md)
function ingests the truncated reporting triangles, retrospective
reporting triangles, and the retrospective point nowcasts and returns a
set of uncertainty parameters corresponding to the specified observation
model. The uncertainty quantification procedure is described
schematically in Figure [3](#fig:uncertainty-quantification).

what was later observed as of the nowcast
time.](../reference/figures/uq.png)

estimates to what was later observed as of the nowcast time.

### Probabilistic nowcast generation

#### Predicted probabilistic nowcast generation

Predictive distributions for \\X\_{t^\*}, \dots, X\_{t^\* - D + 1}\\ are
obtained by generating draws from the observation model, in this case a
negative binomial, with the estimated dispersion parameters and a mean
given by predicted component of the point nowcasts. Specifically, we set

\\ X\_{t, \> t^\* - t} \sim \text{NegBin}(\hat{x}\_{t, \> t^\* - t},
\phi\_{t^\* - t}). \\ This is described in the schematic Figure
[4](#fig:predicted-prob-nowcasts) which depicts sampling from the
observation model with a mean given by the sum of the predicted
components in the point nowcast matrix (the shaded elements in the
bottom right).

![Visual description of the generation of predicted probabilistic
nowcasts generated via sampling from the observation model with the
estimated uncertainty parameters and a mean given by the sum of the
predicted components at each reference
time.](../reference/figures/pred_prob_nowcasts.png)

Figure 4: Visual description of the generation of predicted
probabilistic nowcasts generated via sampling from the observation model
with the estimated uncertainty parameters and a mean given by the sum of
the predicted components at each reference time.

#### Combine with observations to obtain probabilistic nowcasts

The predictive distribution for \\X\_{t}\\ then results by shifting this
distribution by the already known value \\x\_{t, \leq t^\* - t}\\, or in
other words adding the right-truncated partial observed data summed
across reference times and the predicted probabilistic nowcast
components to generate probabilistic nowcasts.

probabilistic predicted nowcast components to generate probabilistic
nowcasts.](../reference/figures/comb_w_obs.png)

Figure 5: Visual description of combining the observations with the
probabilistic predicted nowcast components to generate probabilistic
nowcasts.

The
[`sample_nowcasts()`](https://baselinenowcast.epinowcast.org/reference/sample_nowcasts.md)
function ingests uncertainty parameters, the reporting triangle, and the
point nowcast matrix and generates probabilistic nowcasts.

### Zero-handling strategy

As mentioned in [Point nowcast generation](#point-nowcast-generation),
we use a modified point nowcasts to deal with zero values in preliminary
counts. We here motivate this approach from a Bayesian perspective,
based on the work of^(\[[3](#ref-Morgenstern2025)\]). To this end we
assume that

\\ X\_{t, \leq d} \\ \mid X_t \sim \text{Bin}\left(X_t, \sum\_{d = 0}^d
\pi_t\right). \\ We are now interested in the conditional expectation

\\ \mathbb{E}(X_t \\ \mid X\_{t, \leq d}) \\

in this binomial subsampling problem. We will derive it under the
improper prior distribution

\\ X_t \sim \text{DiscreteUniform}(0, 1, 2, \dots). \\

For notational simplicity and readability for the following, we
substitute \\N = X\_{t}\\, \\Y = X\_{t, \geq d}\\ and \\p = \sum\_{d =
0}^D \pi_d\\ and are thus looking for \\\mathbb{E}(N \| Y = y)\\ if \\Y
\sim \text{Bin}(N, p)\\ with a discrete uniform prior on \\N\\. This
expectation can be written out as: \\ \mathbb{E}(N \\ \| \\ Y = y) =
\sum\_{n=0}^{\infty}\text{Pr}(N = n \| Y = y) \times n
(\\eq:expectation) \\

Applying Bayes Theorem we have \\ \text{Pr}(N = n \\ \|\\ Y = y) =
\frac{\text{Pr}(Y = y \\ \| \\ N = n) \times
\text{Pr}(N=n)}{\sum\_{i=0}^{\infty}\text{Pr}( Y = y \\ \|\\ N= i)
\times \text{Pr}(N = i)}. \\ Because \\\text{Pr}(N=n)\\ is a constant
this simplifies to \\ \text{Pr}(N = n \\ \|\\ Y = y) = \frac{\text{Pr}(Y
= y \\ \|\\ N = n)}{\sum\_{i=0}^{\infty}\text{Pr}( Y = y \\ \|\\ N= i)}.
\\ Now substituting the probability mass function of the binomial
distribution \\ \text{Pr}(Y = y\\ \|\\ N = n) =\binom{n}{y}
p^y(1-p)^{n-y} \\ we get \\ \text{Pr}(N = n \\ \|\\ Y = y) =
\frac{\binom{n}{y} p^y(1-p)^{n-y}}{\sum\_{i=1}^\infty
\binom{1}{y}p^y(1-p)^{i-y}} \\

Plugging this into [(**??**)](#eq:expectation) we get the following
(omitting terms for \\n\<y\\, which are 0):

\\ \mathbb{E}(N \\ \|\\ Y = y) = \sum\_{n=y}^{\infty}n
\frac{\binom{n}{y} p^y(1-p)^{n-y}}{\sum\_{i=y}^\infty
\binom{i}{y}p^y(1-p)^{i-y}} \\

This is equivalent to

\\ \mathbb{E}(N \\ \| \\ Y = y) = \frac{\sum\_{n=y}^{\infty}n
\binom{n}{y} p^y(1-p)^{n-y}}{\sum\_{i=y}^\infty
\binom{i}{y}p^y(1-p)^{i-y}}. \\

Both the numerator and the denominator are known convergent series, with
solutions available in standard libraries like
Mathematica^(\[[4](#ref-Mathematica2024)\]). We then get

\\ \mathbb{E}(N \\ \|\\ Y = y) = \frac{(y + 1 -p)/p^2}{1/p} = \frac{y +
1 - p}{p}, \\ which corresponds to the corrected point estimate provided
in equation [(5)](#eq:correction).

## Default settings

To guide practitioners, we set default behaviours that are based on the
maximum delay observed in the data. We use the partial reporting
triangle for delay estimation, derive delay estimates and uncertainty
estimates from only the reporting triangle being nowcasted, and use
three times the maximum delay number (\\V=3 \times D\\) reference times
for the total training volume \\V\\ used by the model (in line
with^(\[[1](#ref-Wolffram2023)\])).

Within each step there are additional defaults:

*Delay distribution estimation*: 50% of the reference times in the
training volume \\V\\ are used for delay estimation, \\N\\, with a
minimum requirement of at least one more than the maximum delay. If less
data than this is available, this is indicated to the user, only
producing an error when less data than the theoretically minimum is
available for any given modelling step.

*Point nowcast generation*: Delay estimation occurs using the reporting
triangle being nowcasted.

*Uncertainty Estimation*: 50% of the reference times in the training
volume \\V\\ are used as retrospective point nowcast times, \\M\\. If
there is insufficient data, the method uses the oldest retrospective
nowcast date with at least the same amount of historical data for delay
estimation as is used for the point nowcast at the current nowcast date,
and requires that there are at least two retrospective nowcasts
containing sufficient data. By default we do not sum the predicted
components of each row across rows as this is context specific
(diverging from^(\[[1](#ref-Wolffram2023)\]). who sum by week due to
their target data being a rolling 7 day sum).
