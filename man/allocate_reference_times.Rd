\title{Allocate training volume based on combination of defaults and user-specified
values for training volume for delay and uncertainty estimation.}
\usage{
allocate_reference_times(
  reporting_triangle,
  max_delay = ncol(reporting_triangle) - 1,
  scale_factor = 3,
  prop_delay = 0.5,
  size_min_retrospective_nowcasts = 2
)
}
\arguments{
\item{reporting_triangle}{Matrix of the reporting triangle, with rows
representing the time points of reference and columns representing the
delays. Can be a reporting matrix or incomplete reporting matrix.
Can also be a ragged reporting triangle, where multiple columns are
reported for the same row. (e.g. weekly reporting of daily data).}

\item{max_delay}{Integer indicating the maximum delay to estimate, in units
of the delay. The default is to use the whole reporting triangle,
\code{ncol(reporting_triangle) -1}.}

\item{scale_factor}{Numeric value indicating the multiplicative factor on
the maximum delay to be used for estimation of delay and uncertainty.
Default is \code{3}.}

\item{prop_delay}{Numeric value <1 indicating what proportion of all
reference times in the reporting triangle to be used for delay
estimation. Default is \code{0.5}.}

\item{size_min_retro_nowcasts}{Integer indicating the minimum number of
reference times needed for uncertainty estimation. Default is \code{2}.}
}
\value{
list of n_history_delay and n_retrospective_nowcasts
}
\description{
Given the reporting triangle, the maximum delay, and
optionally the user-specified scale factor on the max delay to be used as
total reference times and the proportion of those reference times to
be used for delay estimation, allocate reference times accordingly
