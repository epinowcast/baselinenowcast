\title{Apply the delay to generate a point nowcast}
\usage{
apply_delay(reporting_triangle, delay_pmf)
}
\arguments{
\item{reporting_triangle}{Matrix of the reporting triangle to be
nowcasted, with rows representing the time points of reference and columns
representing the delays}

\item{delay_pmf}{Vector of delays assumed to be indexed starting at the
first delay column in \code{reporting_triangle}.}
}
\value{
\code{point_nowcast_matrix} Matrix of the same number of rows and columns
as the \code{rep_mat_to_nowcast} but with the missing values filled in as point
estimates
}
\description{
Generate a point estimate of a completed reporting square (or rectangle)
from a reporting triangle that we want to complete with a nowcast and a
delay PMF. Each element is computed by taking the product of the expected
number of total cases assigned to a reference time $t$ and the proportion
of those cases reported on delay $d$. The formula to obtain the expected
number of total cases as a function of the reporting delay and previous
observations was derived elsewhere.
