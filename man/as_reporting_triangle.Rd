\title{Create a reporting triangle}
\usage{
as_reporting_triangle(data, max_delay, ...)

\method{as_reporting_triangle}{data.frame}(
  data,
  max_delay,
  strata = NULL,
  reference_date_col_name = "reference_date",
  report_date_col_name = "report_date",
  count_col_name = "count",
  delays_unit = "days",
  ...
)

\method{as_reporting_triangle}{matrix}(
  data,
  max_delay,
  reference_dates,
  strata_list = NULL,
  delays_unit = "days",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Either a matrix of a reporting triangle or a
data.frame to be converted to a reporting triangle matrix.
Can either be in the long tidy format of counts by reference date
and report date or line list data with individual observations
indexed by their reference date and report date.}

\item{max_delay}{Integer indicating the maximum delay to estimate.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to methods. For data.frame method:
\code{strata}, \code{reference_date_col_name}, \code{report_date_col_name},
\code{count_col_name}, \code{delays_unit}. For matrix method: \code{reference_dates},
\code{strata}, \code{delays_unit}.}

\item{strata}{Character string indicating the column names for
stratification e.g. location, age group, weekday. Must correspond
to column names in \code{data}. Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{reference_date_col_name}{Character string indicating the name of the
column which represents the reference date, or the date of the primary
event occurrence.}

\item{report_date_col_name}{Character string indicating the name of the
column which represents the date the primary event was reported.}

\item{count_col_name}{Character string indicating the name of the column
containing the number of incident cases on each reference and report date.}

\item{delays_unit}{Character string specifying the time units to use.
Default is "days".}

\item{reference_dates}{Vector of character strings indicating the reference
dates corresponding to each row of the reporting triangle matrix (\code{data}).}
}
\value{
\code{reporting_triangle} class object which is a list containing:
\itemize{
\item A matrix with which rows are reference times and columns are delays and
entries are incident cases at each reference time and delay.
\item An integer indicating the maximum delay used to create the reporting
triangle
\item A vector of the same length as the rows of the matrix indicating the
dates corresponding to the reference times in the rows of the reporting
triangle.
\item A character string indicating the strata.
\item A vector indicating the "structure" of the reporting triangle.
\item A character string indicating the unit of the delays.
}
}
\description{
Create a reporting triangle

Create a reporting triangle object from a data.frame

Create a reporting triangle object from a matrix
}
\details{
The input needs to be a data.frame or similar with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item Column of type \code{date} or character with the dates of
the primary event occurrence (reference date).
\item Column of type \code{date} or character with the dates of
report of the primary event.
\item Column of numeric or integer indicating the new confirmed counts
pertaining to that reference and report date.
Additional columns can be included but will not be used. The input
dataframe for this function must contain only a single strata, there can
be no repeated reference dates and report dates.
