\title{Combine observed data with a single prediction draw}
\usage{
combine_obs_with_pred(predicted_counts, reporting_triangle)
}
\arguments{
\item{predicted_counts}{Vector of predicted counts at each reference time}
}
\value{
A vector of predicted counts at each reference time
}
\description{
Internally it sums observed counts from the reporting triangle by reference
time and adds them to the predicted counts to form a single draw of the
nowcast for the final counts by reference time.
}

pred_counts <- c(10, 20, 30, 40)

  c(
