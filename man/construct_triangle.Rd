\title{Generate a single retrospective reporting triangle}
\usage{
construct_triangle(trunc_rep_tri, structure = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{trunc_rep_tri}{A single truncated reporting triangle. May or may
not contain NAs.}

\item{structure}{Integer or vector specifying the reporting structure.
If integer, divides columns evenly by that integer (with last possibly
truncated).  If vector, the sum must not be greater than or equal to the
number of columns. Default is 1 (standard triangular structure).}
}
\value{
A single retrospective reporting triangle matrix with NAs in the
appropriate positions.
}
\description{
This function generates a single reporting triangle by removing the bottom
right observations from a truncated reporting triangle matrix. It is the
singular version of \code{construct_triangles()}.
