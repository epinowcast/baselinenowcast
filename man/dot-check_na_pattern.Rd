\title{Check NA pattern validity in reporting triangle}
\usage{
.check_na_pattern(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A matrix or \link{reporting_triangle} object.}
}
\value{
A list with components:
\itemize{
\item \code{valid}: Logical indicating if all NAs are in valid bottom-right pattern
\item \code{n_out_of_pattern}: Count of out-of-pattern NA values
}
}
\description{
Internal function that validates NA positions. Identifies NA values that
don't follow the expected triangular reporting delay pattern. Out-of-pattern
NAs occur when a value is NA but values below it (later reference dates) or
to its right (longer delays) are non-NA, suggesting data quality issues
rather than reporting delay.
}
\details{
An NA is considered "out-of-pattern" if:
\itemize{
\item There exists a non-NA value in the same column but a later row
(indicating data should have been available), OR
\item There exists a non-NA value in the same row but a later column
(indicating earlier delays were reported)
}

Uses a vectorised cummax-based approach for efficient validation.
