.perform_allocation_process(
  reporting_triangle,
  max_delay,
  scale_factor,
  prop_delay,
  size_min_retro_nowcasts
)
}
\arguments{
\item{reporting_triangle}{Matrix of the reporting triangle, with rows
representing the time points of reference and columns representing the
delays. Can be a reporting matrix or incomplete reporting matrix.
Can also be a ragged reporting triangle, where multiple columns are
reported for the same row. (e.g. weekly reporting of daily data).}

\item{max_delay}{Integer indicating the maximum delay to estimate, in units
of the delay. The default is to use the whole reporting triangle,
\code{ncol(reporting_triangle) -1}.}

\item{scale_factor}{Numeric value indicating the multiplicative factor on
the maximum delay to be used for estimation of delay and uncertainty.
Default is \code{3}.}

\item{prop_delay}{Numeric value <1 indicating what proportion of all
reference times in the reporting triangle to be used for delay
estimation. Default is \code{0.5}.}

\item{size_min_retro_nowcasts}{Integer indicating the minimum number of
reference times needed for uncertainty estimation. Default is \code{2}.}
