\title{Validate the inputs to \code{estimate_and_apply_uncertainty()} to ensure that
the reporting triangle, point nowcast matrix, and specified maximum delay
are correct.}
\usage{
.validate_multiple_inputs(point_nowcast_matrix, reporting_triangle, max_delay)
}
\arguments{
\item{point_nowcast_matrix}{Matrix of point nowcast predictions and
observations, with rows representing the reference times and columns
representing the delays.}

\item{reporting_triangle}{Matrix of the reporting triangle, with rows
representing the time points of reference and columns representing the
delays. Can be a reporting matrix or incomplete reporting matrix.
Can also be a ragged reporting triangle, where multiple columns are
reported for the same row. (e.g. weekly reporting of daily data).}

\item{max_delay}{Integer indicating the maximum delay to estimate, in units
of the delay. The default is to use the whole reporting triangle,
\code{ncol(reporting_triangle) -1}.}
}
\value{
NULL, invisibly
}
