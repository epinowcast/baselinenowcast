  triangle,
  max_delay = ncol(triangle) - 1,
  n = nrow(triangle)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{max_delay}{Integer indicating the maximum delay to estimate, in units
of the delay. The default is to use the whole reporting triangle,
\code{ncol(triangle) -1}.}

\item{n}{Integer indicating the number of reference times (observations) to
be used in the estimate of the reporting delay, always starting from the
most recent reporting delay. The default is to use a minimum of the
\code{max_delay} + 1 and a maximum of 50\% of the rows of the reporting
triangle.}
