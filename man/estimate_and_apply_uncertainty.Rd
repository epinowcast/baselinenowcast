\title{Estimate and apply uncertainty to a point nowcast matrix}
\usage{
estimate_and_apply_uncertainty(
  point_nowcast_matrix,
  reporting_triangle,
  max_delay,
  n_retrospective_nowcasts = round(1.5 * max_delay),
  draws = 100,
  error_model = "negative binomial",
  aggregator = sum,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{reporting_triangle}{Matrix of the reporting triangle, with rows
representing the time points of reference and columns representing the
delays. Can be a reporting matrix or incomplete reporting matrix.
Can also be a ragged reporting triangle, where multiple columns are
reported for the same row. (e.g. weekly reporting of daily data).}

\item{max_delay}{Integer indicating the maximum delay to estimate, in units
of the delay. The default is to use the whole reporting triangle,
\code{ncol(reporting_triangle) -1}.}

\item{n_retrospective_nowcasts}{Integer indicating the number of reference
times to use as retrospective nowcast time. Default is 1.5* the maximum
delay}

\item{error_model}{Character string indicating what error model to use.
Default is \code{"negative binomial"}}

\item{aggregator}{Function to aggregate predictions for error estimation.
Default is \code{sum}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments}
}
\value{
\code{nowcast_draws_df} Dataframe containing draws of combined
observations and probabilistic predictions at each reference time.
