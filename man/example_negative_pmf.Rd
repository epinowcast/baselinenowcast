\title{Example reporting triangle with negative PMF entries}
\format{
A matrix with 8 rows and 4 columns.
\describe{
Rows represent reference dates (time points when events occurred).
Columns represent reporting delays (0 to 3 days).
Values represent counts, including negative values at delay 2.
Lower-right triangle contains NA values (unobserved future reports).
}

\usage{

}
\description{
A synthetic reporting triangle that demonstrates a scenario
where systematic downward corrections occur at a specific delay.
This represents a realistic case where data quality reviews at delay 2
consistently identify false positives or reclassify cases, resulting in
net downward adjustments.

When estimated with \code{preprocess = NULL}, this triangle produces a PMF with
at least one negative entry and a CDF that is not strictly increasing.
}
\details{
This example demonstrates the relaxed assumptions for PMF and CDF:
\itemize{
\item With \code{preprocess = NULL}, the PMF can have negative entries
\item The CDF may not be strictly increasing
\item This reflects real reporting processes with systematic corrections
}
}
\seealso{
\itemize{
\item \code{\link[=estimate_delay]{estimate_delay()}} with \code{preprocess = NULL} to preserve negative entries
\item \code{\link[=preprocess_negative_values]{preprocess_negative_values()}} to handle negatives by redistribution
