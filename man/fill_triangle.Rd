\usage{
fill_triangle(
  reporting_triangle,
  n = nrow(reporting_triangle),
  delay_pmf = NULL,
  preprocess = preprocess_negative_values,
  validate = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{reporting_triangle}{A \link{reporting_triangle} object with rows
representing reference times and columns representing delays.
Can be a reporting matrix or incomplete reporting matrix.
Can also be a ragged reporting triangle, where multiple columns are
reported for the same row (e.g., weekly reporting of daily data).}

\item{n}{Integer indicating the number of reference times (observations) to
be used in the estimate of the reporting delay, always starting from the
most recent reporting delay. The default is to use the whole reporting
triangle, so \code{nrow(reporting_triangle)}.}

\item{delay_pmf}{Vector of delays assumed to be indexed
starting at the first delay column in \code{reporting_triangle}.
Default is \code{NULL}, which will estimate a delay from the
\code{reporting_triangle}.}

\item{preprocess}{Function to apply to the truncated triangle before
estimation, or NULL to skip preprocessing. Default is
\code{\link[=preprocess_negative_values]{preprocess_negative_values()}}, which handles negative values by
redistributing them to earlier delays. Set to NULL if you want to preserve
negative PMF entries (e.g., when working with downward corrections where
negative probabilities reflect systematic adjustments). Custom preprocess
functions must accept a \code{validate} parameter (defaults to TRUE) to enable
validation optimisation in internal function chains.}

\item{validate}{Logical. If TRUE (default), validates the object. Set to
FALSE only when called from functions that already validated.}
}
\value{
\code{point_nowcast_matrix} Matrix of the same number of rows and
columns as the \code{reporting_triangle} but with the missing values filled
in as point estimates.
