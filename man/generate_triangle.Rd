\title{Generate a single retrospective reporting triangle}
\usage{
generate_triangle(reporting_triangle, structure = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{reporting_triangle}{A single reporting triangle matrix.}

\item{structure}{Integer or vector specifying the reporting structure.
If integer, divides columns evenly by that integer (with last possibly
truncated).  If vector, must sum to number of columns.
Default is 1 (standard triangular structure).}
}
\value{
A single retrospective reporting triangle matrix with NAs in the
appropriate positions.
}
\description{
This function generates a single reporting triangle by removing the bottom
right observations from a truncated reporting triangle matrix. It is the
singular version of \code{generate_triangles()}.
}

triangle <- matrix(
  c(
