\title{Generate retrospective reporting triangles}
\usage{
generate_triangles(reporting_triangle_list, structure = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{reporting_triangle_list}{List of reporting triangle matrices.}

\item{structure}{Integer or vector specifying the reporting structure.
If integer, divides columns evenly by that integer (with last possibly
truncated).  If vector, must sum to number of columns.
Default is 1 (standard triangular structure).}
}
\value{
\code{rep_tri_mat_list} List of retrospective reporting triangles,
generated by removing the bottom right observations from the truncated
reporting triangle matrices.
}
\description{
This function ingests a list of truncated reporting matrices and iteratively
generates the reporting triangle that would have been available as of the
maximum reference time, working from bottom to top for \code{n} snapshots.
