\title{Estimate a delay distribution from a reporting triangle
Provides an estimate of the reporting delay as a function
of the delay, based on the reporting triangle and the specified maximum
delay and number of reference date observations to be used in the
estimation. This point estimate of the delay is computed empirically,
using an iterative algorithm starting from the most recent observations.

  reporting_triangle,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{reporting_triangle}{Matrix of the reporting triangle, with rows
representing the time points of reference and columns representing the
delays. Can be a reporting matrix or incomplete reporting matrix.
Can also be a ragged reporting triangle, where multiple columns are
reported for the same row. (e.g. weekly reporting of daily data).}

\item{max_delay}{Integer indicating the maximum delay to estimate, in units
of the delay. The default is to use the whole reporting triangle,
\code{ncol(triangle) -1}.}

\item{n}{Integer indicating the number of reference times (observations) to
be used in the estimate of the reporting delay, always starting from the
most recent reporting delay. The default is to use the whole reporting
triangle, so \code{nrow(triangle)}.}
}
\value{
Vector indexed at 0 of length \code{max_delay + 1} with columns
indicating the point estimate of the empirical probability
mass on each delay.
