\title{Get a draw of only the predicted elements of the nowcast vector}
\usage{
get_nowcast_pred_draw(point_nowcast_matrix, reporting_triangle, dispersion)
}
\arguments{
\item{point_nowcast_matrix}{Matrix of point nowcast predictions and
observations, with rows representing the reference times and columns
representing the delays.}

\item{reporting_triangle}{Matrix of the reporting triangle, with rows
representing the time points of reference and columns representing the
delays. Can be a reporting matrix or incomplete reporting matrix.
Can also be a ragged reporting triangle, where multiple columns are
reported for the same row. (e.g. weekly reporting of daily data).}

\item{dispersion}{Vector of dispersion parameters indexed by horizon from
minus one to the maximum delay.}
}
\value{
Vector of predicted draws at each reference time, for all reference
times in the input \code{point_nowcast_pred_matrix}.
}
