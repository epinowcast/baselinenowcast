\title{Preprocess negative values in the reporting triangle}
\usage{
preprocess_negative_values(triangle)
}
\arguments{
\item{triangle}{A \link{reporting_triangle} object or matrix with rows
representing the time points of reference and columns representing delays.}
}
\value{
A \link{reporting_triangle} object (if input was reporting_triangle) or
matrix with negative values handled via redistribution to earlier delays.
}
\description{
Takes in a reporting triangle and returns it with negative values of
reporting handled by redistributing them to earlier delays (from longer
delay to shorter). This is useful when dealing with reporting corrections
that can result in negative incremental counts.

When negative values are detected, they are set to zero and the negative
amount is subtracted from the count at the next earlier delay (moving from
right to left in each row). This process continues until either the
negative value is fully absorbed or the first delay is reached.

\details{
Use this function when:
\itemize{
\item Your data contains reporting corrections that result in negative counts
\item You want to preserve the total count while handling negatives
\item You need a delay distribution that sums to 1 or a CDF that is weakly
increasing
}

Set \code{preprocess = NULL} in \code{\link[=estimate_delay]{estimate_delay()}} when:
\itemize{
\item Your data naturally has negative PMF entries (e.g., from differencing)
\item You want to preserve the original structure including negatives
\item You are working with corrections that should be reflected as negative
probabilities
}
}
