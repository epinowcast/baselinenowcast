\title{Get a draw of only the predicted elements of the nowcast vector}
\usage{
sample_prediction(
  point_nowcast_matrix,
  reporting_triangle,
  uncertainty_params,
  observation_model = sample_nb,
  ref_time_aggregator = identity,
  delay_aggregator = function(x) rowSums(x, na.rm = TRUE)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{point_nowcast_matrix}{Matrix of point nowcast predictions and
observations, with rows representing the reference times and columns
representing the delays.}

\item{reporting_triangle}{Matrix of the reporting triangle, with rows
representing the time points of reference and columns representing the
delays. Can be a reporting matrix or incomplete reporting matrix.
Can also be a ragged reporting triangle, where multiple columns are
reported for the same row. (e.g. weekly reporting of daily data).}

\item{uncertainty_params}{Vector of uncertainty parameters ordered from
horizon 1 to the maximum horizon. Note that these will be reversed
internally to match the ordering of the \code{point_nowcast_matrix} (where
a horizon of 1 is the last entry).}

\item{observation_model}{Function that ingests a vector or matrix of
predictions and a vector of uncertainty parameters and generates draws
from the observation model. Default is \code{sample_nb} which expects
arguments \code{pred} for the vector of predictions and uncertainty parameters
for the corresponding vector of uncertainty parameters, and draws from a
negative binomial for each element of the vector.}

\item{ref_time_aggregator}{Function that operates along the rows (reference
times) of the retrospective point nowcast matrix before it has been
aggregated across columns (delays). Default is \code{identity}
which does not aggregate across reference times.}

\item{delay_aggregator}{Function that operates along the columns (delays)
of the retrospective point nowcast matrix after it has been aggregated
across reference times. Default is \code{function(x) rowSums(x, na.rm = TRUE)}.}
}
\value{
Vector of predicted draws at each reference time, for all reference
times in the input \code{point_nowcast_matrix}.
