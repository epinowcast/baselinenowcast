\alias{truncate_triangle}
\title{Get a single truncated triangle}
\usage{
truncate_triangle(t, reporting_triangle)
}
\arguments{
\item{t}{Integer indicating the number of timepoints to truncate off the
bottom of the original reporting triangle.}

\item{reporting_triangle}{Matrix of the reporting triangle, with rows
representing the time points of reference and columns representing the
delays. Can be a reporting matrix or incomplete reporting matrix.
Can also be a ragged reporting triangle, where multiple columns are
reported for the same row. (e.g. weekly reporting of daily data).}
}
\value{
\code{trunc_rep_tri} Matrix with \code{t} fewer rows than
\code{reporting_triangle}.
}
\description{
This function takes in a integer \code{t} and a reporting triangle and generates
a truncated reporting triangle, remove the last \code{t} observations.
